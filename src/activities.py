    Returns a list of activities sorted by distance from the user's home.

    Use this tool when a user asks for nearby events or activities, or when the request includes keywords like:
    "close to me", "nearby", "within X miles", or specifies a location like a home address or city.

    The tool calculates the driving distance (in kilometers) between the user's provided home address and each activity's location.

    Inputs:
    - home_address (string): The full address or city/town the user is located at or wants to start from.

    Outputs:
    - A dictionary with:
        - `home`: the address used for comparison
        - `results`: list of activity entries with:
            - activity name
            - location (address)
            - distance_km (float): rounded to 2 decimal places

    Typical use cases:
    - "What are some weekend activities near me?"
    - "Find events within 20 km of Springfield."
    - "Anything we can do thatâ€™s close to our house?"

    Do not use this tool if the user's location is unknown or ambiguous.
